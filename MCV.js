des=[["This digital artwork helps me release stress by showcasing the absurdity of unhinged confidence and how it can affect people who overestimate themselves. Overconfidence might be a bad thing, a poison that leads to bigotry and ignorance. I have learned that confidence is a double-edged sword which can be my ally or enemy at times. Confidence is something abstract that can't be seen. I have learned to take everything with a pinch of salt and not to assume that anything that appears easy is actually easy. Nothing is truly easy because the perception of something being easy can often lead me to overlook the simplest problems. Thus, be cautious and never naive, as 'Nothing comes easy in life without a price to pay."],
    ["i love looking at the sky at any time of day. it’s so beautiful that any stress i’m feeling can melt away in that moment. this particular shot was mesmerising to me as it looked like a ray of hope shining through the haze of clouds. it fills me with hope and determination that despite any hardships, good things will shine through if you just hold onto your hopefulness."],
    ["Immerse myself in the allure of this captivating view from a foreign land. It serves as a poignant reminder for me to appreciate every little thing in my life and to consistently treat myself with compassion. A note to self echoes: 'Looking at beauty in the world is the first step in purifying the mind’."],
    ["Moonshot refers to a plan or aim to do something that seems almost impossible. It serves as a reminder that unless you dare to dream, a dream can change everything. It is bigger than you could ever imagine, but it is something you just can't ignore. It is a feeling deep in your gut."],
    ["Sometimes, I gaze at the evening sunset, an exquisite and calming marvel of nature. It's okay to stumble and face failures; life continues regardless. I always remind myself to keep my chin up, knowing that one day, I will overcome. The sunset prompts me to perceive the bright side of everything in life—even situations that seem unfavourable can hold hidden goodness. Don't let a single negative incident steal my smile, for there's always light at the end of the tunnel. Instead of tears for its end, smile for its occurrence."],
    ["A small treat of discovering a beautiful little flower from my neighbour's garden on one of my weekends. Taking photographs to showcase its beauty cherished my day."],
    ["Having a gathering while enjoying my favourite food and letting go of my feelings is good for my mental health. Food unites everyone regardless of culture; food makes us happy. Being in this place is special to me because I can feel the warmth and energy in the crowd. This place gathers friends and loved ones while enjoying good food. Sometimes it is okay to feel burned out; remember to go out, have fun, and relax, and do not be too hard on yourself. Learn to enjoy the little things in life; life is too short for us to worry. Just follow the flow and don’t think too much; enjoy the food and company like the one here."],
    ["The perpetual turning of the Ferris Wheel of life encapsulates us in the eternal torture of repetition with the yearning for signs of metamorphosis. Scavenging for stimulants, yet being unconsciously desensitised towards it, morphing into a punishment by Dopamine. Though the emancipation brought forward by Endorphin is obvious, even trivial, who if any would like to embark on such a journey? One must imagine Sisyphus happy, one must imagine oneself, free. Though the ephemeral sunset, and so is our gratification and anguish, one must remember, of the good thing, that is scattered yet omnipresent."],
    ["Walking at night is therapeutic; the cold breeze is relaxing. As I stroll through the park, I get to unwind my mind and immerse myself in nature. I have learned that life is not always straightforward and rosy but rather full of trials and challenges. It is up to us to make the most out of these experiences, becoming better individuals and learning from each one. Don't be afraid to explore new things because life becomes monotonous when you remain within the confines of what you already know"],
    ["Everytime I’m at the beach, it’s like my stress is forgotten. I feel peace whenever I'm at the beach, it gives me a calming vibe that everything will turn out fine. Listening to the waves of the ocean is like music to my ears."],
    [`My friend took this photo and sent it to me with the message: 'One day you will shine beautifully somewhere you didn't expect. Embracing Life's Transitions. Just as the rose finds its beauty under the fading light, remember that even in moments of change and uncertainty, there is a quiet strength within you. Each transition is a step toward a new dawn, where your resilience blooms.`],
    [`Throughout our lives, people must endure numerous trials, experience gatherings and partings, tread through perilous paths and fiery trials, and constantly engage in a battle against an intangible self—whether it be their past self or an imagined self. Yet, even amidst the desert, you can still become that rose. This rose doesn't necessarily have to be red; it could also be blue, green, yellow, white, purple, or even transparent. You are yourself, and in that, you are also your own hero.`],
    [`The lockdowns in 2020-2021 were a tumultuous time filled with uncertainty. On the bright side, I rediscovered drawing as a creative outlet and a way to reduce screen time. To this day, drawing continues to bring me a great sense of peace.`,`The use of a semicolon here is symbolic; it represents hope and the continuation of life for those facing mental health challenges. According to Project Semicolon, "A semicolon is used when an author could've chosen to end their sentence but chose not to. The author is you, and the sentence is your life.`,`The flowers growing from the semicolon signify new life, and it's also a testament to my love for drawing plants. This visual reminder reassures us that tough times will pass. Always remember, you're not alone; reach out to those you trust.`],
    [`Find beauty in things around you.`],
    [`It was very relaxing to draw this picture because it made me forget about other things that day and I haven't used crayons for years. I had a lot of fun creating this piece of artwork with a friend and I focused more on the process rather than the result. I think it's important to enjoy drawing and be present, even if the finished product is not as expected.`],
    [`My feelings needed an outlet; they guided my painting. Through painting, I saved myself from the abyss, stroke by stroke, bit by bit, inch by inch. I emerged from it.`],
    [`Autistic people feel a range of emotions from happiness, shock, sadness and many more. However, they tend to feel it in a deeper, more intense way than we do. They are more sensitive and aware of their environment due to their deep connection to their senses, which shows that they feel the same things we feel, but with more intensity– making them unique but never less.`],

    [`Reality can be harsh. The Covid-19 pandemic is like a layer of oil in the sea of our lives that keeps us from breathing. This painting is about those who are stuck at the bottom. They face challenges that pile up from unemployment, the distancing of relationships and mental health issues from the lack of contact and many more. The various expressions painted on this canvas represent a struggle of anger, shock, momentary happiness and depression. The heads are close to each other, showing how fast one's mood can change due to the hectic life in the pandemic.`],

    [`Do you think we create our own destiny, or that it is already written & whatever is happening is merely happening according to script?`,`Even when we look back & can identify exactly when & what we chose which led us up to this point of time, is this autonomy merely an illusion?`,`Sometimes it may seem like a ‘damned if I do, damned if I don’t’ situation.`,`Kafkaesque - a term derived from the name of writer Franz Kafka.`,`Kafka’s work sought not to alleviate the soul through remedies of false hope or delusion, but rather, through the direct confrontation with the darker aspects of self. By distorting reality to map more accurately onto his own sense of human experience, he revealed a certain remedy of unhindered self-examination & carved out a place in the world for others to do the same. (Source) `,`What I like about his works is that despite it all, the protagonists never just lie down & give up. They still endeavour to overcome.`,  
    `Some critics argue that Kafka’s works are more joyful than they may appear - he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems.`,`When you come to accept that there is no problem - either everything is already pre-planned, or that problems are merely created…what else to do but enjoy & be happy!`],

    `Loneliness & aloneness both teach us so much about life & ourselves.`,
    `Loneliness - you do what you have to do to survive & get through it. Sometimes one day at a time, sometimes one hour at a time, sometimes one minute at a time...a seemingly never-ending war against the jabberwockies in your mind.`,
    `You lose some people, you learn how to hold your own hand, you learn how to cry out to God & surrender to the powers that be.`,
    `In the end, you learn how to stand solid in your aloneness. There is a sense of peace in the chaos of nothingness. You learn how to take things in your stride. How to say no to what you don't want/need, yes to what you want/need. With the understanding that what you want & what you need may sometimes be two very different things.`,
    `There is a certain melancholy or the loss of this 'innocence' - the illusion of loneliness. After all, life's always better together, right?`,
    `Yet there is a tremendous sense of pride for emerging standing tall after having courageously strode through it all. An aloneness which no one can take away from you. Ever.`,
    `Deserts & tundras are similar yet dissimilar. There is a sense of nothingness in both. A nothingness which transcends time, space & borders. How we perceive & face this nothingness changes everything.`,
    `The nothingness is not your enemy - on the contrary, it is your most valuable ally.`],
    [`“Weightlessness. The feeling of soaring above the clouds on a sunny spring morning. A chilly breeze intermingles the caramel-sweet scent of cotton candy with delicate wisps of clouds. Memories of happy childhood days at the amusement park, when tiny chubby hands were held tight by Mummy & Daddy’s giant hands, & the sun’s rays lightly warmed the skin. The gentle hustle & bustle of young & old, the excited screams from the roller-coaster, the sereneness of the Ferris Wheel.`,

The waterfall is the state of her mind; When we are busy and do not have time to rest, eventually, we feel drained and our mood is affected by tiredness. When this lady is sleeping, her mind starts flowing out like a peaceful`,`waterfall. The plant comes to life near the waterfall while some soil and rock look dry. The dry soil and rock represent our health. A full moon means we are going through the same cycle. We rest, do our thing, get tired and then rest."`],
    [`Depicting the magical creature, unicorn in abstract elements, the artist wants to portray the message that magic is all around us throughout our life journey - all it takes to see and experience this magic is our courage to believe, have faith and carry on. `,
    `Just like the magical and mystical creature unicorn, its existence started with the courage to believe, and its magical spirit lives on all around the world, within all ages, to those who believe. :) `,
    `When viewing upclose, there are tracks or traces of pathway that may or may not be covered with glitters on this canvas. That is akin to the pathway we take in our lives, and the various different experiences we encounter. Again, it takes courage, faith and action to carry on walking through those pathway in our lives. The experiences are for us to feel, see and live on - whether magical or not, that is up to us too.`],
    [`Butterfly Effect is also a symbol of transformation for the artist. There is this beauty of how when one thing or one person transforms, that will have a ripple effect to the surroundings too. `,
    `Back then in 2016, when the artist had the above concept in her mind, she found it amazing how energy works in such a way. Fast forward to the current time, the artist understands that is indeed how the Universe works - that everything around us is energy, and hence they bounce back and forth, affecting one another. `
    ,`This is one of the older paintings that the artist holds dear to her heart. It is now, time to share this with the world, so that its beautiful energy can be shared to others out there too, hence living by its name, spreading / creating that butterfly effect.`],

In the center of this artwork is a brain MRI of a person diagnosed with depression."`],
    [`“Individuals diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) often find themselves repetitively doing tasks, gestures, speaking or counting with an unjustified fear that stopping the action will cause something worse happening. OCD patients often describe their life as living with constant anxiety, a buzzing brain that just won’t stop.`,`In the center of this artwork is a brain MRI of a person with severe OCD.”`],
    [`“Schizophrenia patients often find it hard to differentiate between reality and what they perceive as real, leading to psychotic breakdowns, intrusive voices in their head and hallucinations that get them labeled and dismissed as just crazy. However, with modern science, it is now a condition that is treatable and manageable provided that the patient has a strong support system. In the center of this artwork is a brain MRI of a person with schizophrenia.”`],
    [`“The background of the painting - pink and black - represents outer purity and inner imperfection. White flowers symbolize modesty and elegance, while red flowers symbolize respect, desire, passionate love and strength. The surroundings, especially pink and white Sakura, represent that life is short and beautiful. The group of small colorful flowers symbolizes the human’s emotions and feelings.”`],
    [`“The background of this painting, black, represents many challenges. The symbolism of an eagle represents reminding yourself to be courageous and stretch your limits. When the spirit of the eagle comes into a man, the fear, doubt, diffidence, humiliation, disrepute, and weakness will never get in the man’s way.” `],
    [`“This painting represents having both a person and emotion or feeling be connected together. Pride can be strengthened or weakened when the feeling gets boosted or hurt.
